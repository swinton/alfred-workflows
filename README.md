# My Alfred Workflows
Just a collection of [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) workflows is all:

- `plaintextify`: uses [pbpaste](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/pbpaste.1.html) to paste the clipboard contents as plain text
- `sha`: generates a SHA-1, using the current date
- `slugify`: generates a [slug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_URL#Slug) from the input
